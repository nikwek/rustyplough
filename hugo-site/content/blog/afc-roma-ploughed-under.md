On a radiant morning under the brilliant blue skies of Salesian Middle School, the Over-50 soccer scene staged a masterpiece. The half-field pitch, modest in size but brimming with potential, bore witness to a 7v7 clash that felt larger than life: **AFC Roma versus Ploughed Under**.

The 10:30 AM kickoff saw Ploughed Under in a classic 2-3-2 formation, blending tactical discipline with flashes of creative chaos. From the first whistle, the game was alive—every pass, tackle, and run infused with the undying passion that makes this sport eternal but shot in slow motion.

Jamie opened the scoring for PU with a strike so pure it could have been scripted. A moment of poise and precision, the ball soared into the net, and for a brief second, time stood still. The cheer(s) rang out, a testament to football's ageless thrill.

AFC Roma found their rhythm, grinding their way back, scoring two goals on the PU. It was 1:2 at half time but coach Moriconi had a secret weapon: Paddy Fisher.

Fisher was tasked with motivating, nay threatening the Ploughed Under to get their asses into gear and perform as only he knew they could.

It was Rafa who turned the match's tide once more. Rising like a phoenix, he met the ball with a glancing header that was all elegance, leaving defenders rooted and the keeper helpless.

As the game ebbed and flowed, Franco Moriconi, the Italian virtuoso, pulled the strings like a symphony conductor. Late in the second half, he delivered a cross that was nothing short of art—a beauty that rolled across the box, begging to be finished. Nik, ever the team player, received it cooly, one-touched it with his left foot to Martin, who was as wide open as a morning field. Martin's finish was clinical, if the clinic was for geriatric ballet dancers, sealing a thrilling 3-2 victory for Ploughed Under.

Post-match, the players retired to Fieldwork Brewing, swapping tales of missed chances and glorious goals over well-earned pints. Sunshine on their faces, camaraderie in the air, and the knowledge that they had lived the game as it was meant to be played—this, truly, is the essence of football.
