If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

Similarly, if the Rusty Plough play a match but no one takes a team picture (or any pictures at all), did it really happen?

According to the EBSSL website, the answer to that second question is, unfortunately, yes.

Despite the lack of photographic evidence, I can report that the Rusty Plough looked resplendent in their iconic yellow kits on Sunday as we took the field at Gabe West at the early hour of 9:00 a.m.  The sponsor Trumer Pils’ logo glowed especially bright in the early morning light.

On the heels of last week’s strong performance against league leaders Oakland OGs, Manager Franco Moriconi felt suitably bullish about the Plough’s prospect against La Selecta.  Looking across the field prior to the game, the opponents looked short on subs, and, well, mostly short (not to mention mostly roundish).

Moriconi rejected last week’s Christmas tree formation in favor of his preferred 4-4-2.  New recruit Akio got the start in central midfield alongside the welcome return of Steve Weinstein to the pitch after back pain had kept him out of action.  Peter Welch and Jason Yeo led the line up top, the defense was anchored by the formidable foursome of Roberto Viveros, Jamie Cope, Logan Hennessy and Captain Jose Herrarte.  Your reporter and Dale Webber occupied the left and right side of midfield, respectively.  The redoubtable Phil Blair was between the pipes in place of the injured Dave Forsyth.  The Plough’s ranks were also bolstered by the addition of young Patrick James eager to continue his goal-scoring exploits from the United Kingdom while wearing the Rusty Plough badge.

The game began with the Plough dominating possession and launching multiple probing attacks on the La Selecta goal.  This culminated in an early goal around the ten minute mark or so.  Peter had the ball outside the right side of the penalty area and played a cross into the center of the box.  Akio rose up and deftly nodded the ball on towards the back post into the space where your faithful correspondent had arrived in time to send a glancing header inside the back post and away from the keeper (or as Fisher would put it, he didn’t fuck it up). Rusty Plough 1-0.

Sometime around this point, it became apparent to those on the field that the 4-4-2 had been replaced by a different formation involving Jamie playing 20-30 yards in front of his former center back partner Roberto.  It seems that Moriconi felt that a three-back line could handle La Selecta.

In a possibly unrelated development, La Selecta scored two goals against the run of play and in somewhat rapid succession when their short, round#23turned out to be exceedingly fast (in the context of over-40 soccer) and surprisingly skillful.  I think there’s an Italian term for it….

The manager put PJ on along with Michael Furlong in the hopes of getting one or two goals back, but despite their best efforts and those of Peter, Jason and Dale, no goal was forthcoming.  Halftime found the Plough down 1-2.

Assessing his charges, Moriconi weighed his options.  He was heard to say that we would need to score three goals to get a win.  At the time it seemed he misspoke given a 1-goal deficit, but he may just have been prescient.  There was also some debate between Jamie and Roberto regarding Jamie challenging him to a sprint to midfield to determine who was slower (or faster?).  Roberto ceded the challenge perhaps due to exhaustion from chasing#23for 45 minutes and gladly swapped positions with Jamie to start the second half.

Moriconi threw the dice again and started the Plough in yet another formation.  This time it was a 3-4-3 with PJ, Peter and Jason leading the line, Gerrado and Roberto in the center of midfield and myself and Dale on the wings.  Jamie, Akio and Jose formed the back line.

The Plough went at them hard to start the half.  Dale and Jason on the right side toiled tirelessly in the attack and helped cover the right side in defense.  Logan swapped in for Akio in the defense, and he, Jamie and Jose challenged every loose ball, winning most of them.  Despite our best efforts, however, the tying goal eluded us.

Again, against the run of play, La Selecta scored.  I actually don’t recall much about the how’s or why’s of it, but it definitely made Franco’s prediction that we’d need to score three seem to come true.  The Plough again redoubled their collective efforts.  Gerrardo hit a vicious half-volley that was barely denied by the crossbar.  Jason sent a cross into the area that was one crappy field bounce away from being hammered in by PJ.  Jason also hit an excellent drive that the keeper parried.  On a corner from Peter, Logan just missed putting the ball inside the near post.  Furlong executed a lovely turn at the top of the area that was reminiscent of his play against the Raiders, but alas, it went for naught.  Patrick Fisher entered the fray and did his best to help the Plough turn the tide.

Little number 23 continued to harass the Plough defense whenever he had the chance.  On many occasions, we were fortunate that his teammates decided to try to take matters into their own hands rather than simply give him the ball.  When he finally did have an opportunity, he got on the wrong side of Jamie and then tumbled to the turf with the slightest of provocations.  The ref (who was not bad to be fair) pointed immediately to the spot.  Number 23 looked confident but then hammered the ball (over? Around? Not sure where but not on frame), and the Plough breathed again.

Late in the game, Jose may have played a square ball from the left side of the field towards Jamie without realizing that#23was standing directly in between him and Jamie.  But then again, my memory may be cloudy on this point.  After the embarrassment of the missed PK,#23did not spurn this opportunity (despite a valiant effort by Phil to deny him).  Rusty Plough 1-4.

All in all, it still seems a little bewildering that we lost this game, let alone by such a seemingly lopsided scoreline.  The team played well, the team played with positivity throughout, and the team supported one another all over the pitch.  Since Hudson wasn’t there to scold us (congrats Carlin!), I will say it was a moral victory if not an actual one.  Thankfully Fieldwork was open at 11:00 a.m.

Onward and upward!
