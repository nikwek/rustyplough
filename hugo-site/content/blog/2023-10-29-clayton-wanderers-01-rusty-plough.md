Expectations were low as the Rusty Plough assembled for an afternoon match against Clayton Wanderers. Clayton were top of the table with 7 straight wins and a +23 goal differential. The Rusties, on the other hand, were 9th of 11 with a goal differential of -3 (and having only scored 13 goals all season vs Clayton’s 30).

Despite the late kickoff, the Plough assembled slowly at Gabe East. Those that arrived on time chose the traditional yellow kits with lead sponsor Trumer Pils emblazoned across the front.

Manager Wekwerth looked at his pre-planned starting roster, and then looked at the players that actually showed up on time. He looked at his lineup again, and then threw away his plan. Despite the 2023-24 Rusty Plough youth movement, it was the Emeritus players who arrived on time. While the manager found their experience in big game situations comforting, he also found their overall level of “experience” to be troubling.

Suddenly, Peter Welch stepped forward to address the motley collection. “Look. We’re gonna get killed today, but at least we can make them work hard for their victory. Let’s move as a unit. We let them have possession in their own half and we don’t press unless we’re all up close to the mid-field. Let’s make them work hard for everything.”

The Rusties agreed to this far-fetched plan and manager Wekwerth set the squad up in a 4-2-3-1 formation.

Given the afternoon start, Rusty keeper Patrick James wanted to defend the southern goal. The Rusties won the toss and immediately declared victory for the day. The Wanderers then kicked off.

The match started as expected with the Wanderers passing the ball freely in their own half. But, as they approached midfield, the organized and determined Plough harassed the Wanderers and made it difficult for them to find attacking passes. At first, they prodded the Plough’s left flank. Jeff Faucette, playing left back, cut off passing lanes, got stuck in, and generally ensured that they found no joy. The Wanderers switched sides.

On the Rusty right, manager Wekwerth had installed the Plough’s most experienced player, 72 year old Mike Costello, at right back. Despite having a speed advantage, the Wanderers struggled to beat Costello’s keen sense of timing and understanding of the game. There was one moment when the Wanderers wing got past the crafty Costello and into the penalty box. Costello extended both arms in an attempt to keep the wing from getting to the ball. This brought about shouts of “Mike! Don’t do it!” from the Rusties but, fortunately, the wing was too quick and Mike’s attempted shove in the back found nothing but air. The penalty was avoided.

However, the Wanderers earned a corner kick. The kick was well taken, but the Rusty defense held. There was then a period where the Wanderers seemed to have a never ending series of corner kicks. On each kick, Eric Kuehnl ensured that the Plough knew that an inswinger was coming. And, generally, the Plough was stout. On the last of their series of corners, the ball did not in-swing and rather went to the top of the box. The ball was deflected high and centerback Hudson went to clear. But keeper James screamed “KEEPER!” and shoved Hudson out of the way and punched the ball. However, it did not get far and was soon lobbed back in. “KEEPER” was yelled again and, again, a punch that did not quite clear and then, a shot that hit the crossbar and then the ball was loose in the box. A post was hit! The ball was free, more attempts, more players converging, cats and dogs living together! - it was mass pandemonium. Somehow the ball stayed out and the score remained tied.

Shortly thereafter, through the excellent combination work of Eric and Peter up the Plough’s left side, the Rusties earned a corner. Peter delivered an excellent ball into the box. Hudson, the Salmon, leapt as high as he could (video evidence would later confirm that his feet actually left the ground), and got his head to the ball. Unfortunately, he could not quite hit it down and it sailed just over the Wanderers net.

The Rusties probably should have actually scored when the Wanderers played a horrible clearance out of the defense and right into Freddie’s (Lopez / Delgadillo?) path. He knocked it down in the center of the pitch, just 25 yards from goal. He stepped forward and launched a strike towards the Wanderers’ net, but the shot started to tail to the right and wound up wide of the net.

Things started getting interesting at this point. More, and younger, Rusties arrived and the manager saw a chance to relieve the pressure on the Emeriti. But then, Andy Waranoff, who always works as hard as possible, stretched to keep a ball from going out of bounds. The stretch was too much for his hamstring and he retired to the bench. Not long after that, keeper James informed the manager that his hamstring had gone and he would need to be replaced. Freddie was seen rubbing the back of his legs. The Emeriti would have to persevere.

The Wanderers and the Rusty Plough made it to half time knotted at 0. The Rusties were clearly the more happy with this situation. But there were challenges ahead. Jamie Cope, an imposing presence at center back, agreed to sub in for the injured James.  The Emeriti, though tiring from their extended playing time, would remain needed.

The Plough retained their shape into the second half. The Wanderers seemed to also keep the same shape, but moved the reasonably fast and skilled#14up-front.

Much like in the first half, the Wanderers struggled to find space to make passes. Ben Beach came in at center back for Cope, and proceeded to intercept, harass and otherwise thwart the Wanderers. Weinstein and Gerardo Delgadillo played tremendously as the holding backs, working together, harassing the Wanderers, helping the Plough defense clear the lines and filling in the gaps. Faucette, now playing on the right side because, apparently, the manager wants to make sure he’s as far from him as possible, was all over the place challenging for

balls, intercepting passes and defending solidly. Lewis Knight and Michael Furlong took turns as the sole striker and provided outlet opportunities, harassed the Wanderer defenders and generally caused chaos. Former manager and current Emeriti Moriconi made several appearances in the mid-field using his deft touch, superior vision, and dazzling good looks to stymie the opposition. He played so well, many thought that Isabella was watching.

Adam Faughnan deserves a special mention for playing all over the mid-field as he was constantly asked to take on all roles as subs came in and took the positions they were most comfortable with. His efforts helped ensure that The Wanderers could find no peace. Adam also had a chance to score from a long ball played into the Wanderers box, but he couldn’t quite get the ball completely under his control and his shot wound up wide right.

Clayton began to sense that they needed to up their game against the surprisingly stout Rusties. They began to try to slide in longer passes to their two strikers. The Rusties had elected to not play their traditional high line and the deeper set allowed them to intercept many of these balls. One pass did find#14on the Rusty left side. He turned quickly and fired a shot that went just wide of the far post. The Plough breathed a sigh of relief.

#14was increasingly frustrated and demanded the ball more and more. Each time he received it, he used his left foot (he only had a left foot) and tried to pivot towards the goal to find a shot. Had he only been less selfish, he would have likely found his strike partner open on the other side of the penalty box, but his desire to score blinded him and benefited the Plough who blocked most of his attempts.

With ten minutes remaining a high ball was launched into the bright sun and towards the Plough goal. Sub-keeper Cope came to the top of the box while Hudson shielded the Wanderer striker. Hudson fully expected Jamie to catch the ball, but Jamie thought he was out of the box. The ball hit the ground and squirted towards the goal. Details remain confused, but somehow the Rusties managed to prevent the ball from sneaking in at their left post. At this point, Gerardo started shouting at everyone. “This is not OK! We must play better!”. The Plough was moved.

With 5 to go, Lewis had harassed a defender and helped earn the Plough a throw-in at almost the Wanderer touch line. Eric ran up to take the throw. But rather than throw a long, deep lob into the middle of the box, he threw a low dart straight towards Peter. Peter bent forward, allowed the ball to clear his head, and then threw his head back. The ball looped off of Peter’s head and towards the back post. The Wanderer’s tall keeper looked up and began to back-pedal. The defenders all strained to block the shot, time stood still.. But the loop was too high

and the trajectory was too pure. It found the upper corner at the far post. The Plough was in the lead!

The Wanderers now came at the Rusties with everything they could muster, but the Rusties were resolute. With about one minute left, Cope intercepted a pass near the top of the 18. He then dropped the ball and fell on it looking like a very amateur version of a professional goalie seeking to waste time.

The Wanderers managed one more shot, but it went wide. The ref blew the whistle immediately after the resulting goal kick and the Rusties had earned an historic victory.

After the match, the Rusties gathered at the Trumer Pils Tap Room (1404 Fourth Street, Berkeley, CA) to discuss all of the things that went right:

They had a planThey actually followed the planThey effectively wasted more time during the game than any team has ever managed (hats off to Mike Costello for needing three attempts to throw the ball over the fence to get play restarted)They were lucky to not have scored early as that might have pissed the Wanderers off

Their joy was so infectious that the sponsor purchased a round for the smiling victors.

The win moved the Rusties up to 7th in the table and made the race for the title much more exciting. During his post-match interview, Manager Wekwerth was heard saying “It’z one of those things with a quality league like the EBSSL. On any Sunday, any team can beat another team. It’s why we have such tremendous viewership and worldwide interest.”

Peter’s amazing goal will long be remembered as one of the Rusty Plough’s greatest moments.
