Rusty Plough 1:1 Orinda FC

It was an unusually foggy morning as the Rusty Plough gathered for the first game of the 2023-24 season. The summer transfer window was active with several new signings and the promotion of several stalwarts to the Emeritus squad. The Emeritus players areMike Costello, one of the first members of the Starry Plough protector of the right-flank, and most-fit septuagenarian ever.Franco Moriconi, the

beautiful number 10, long-time manager, and creator of the 4-4-2.Michael Furlong, our#6, possessor of the world’s slowest backheel, Director of Propaganda and one of the most dedicated servants to the club.David Moffat, a dominating field player, annual burner, ski-bum extraordinaire, and holder of the cash.Donal O’Sullivan, never offsides, sometimes an actual 9, occasionally a Falso Nove, and the real

brains behind the management. AndLewis Knight, never a Starry, but a dedicated Rusty with a shot that terrified the over 40’s keepers.

The Emeriti are planning the next evolution of the Plough for the 2024-25 season and will make appearances throughout the campaign to ensure that quality standards are being upheld.

Our new signees are Ben Beach, Alfredo Delgadillo, Adam Faughnan, Jeremy Giovannetti, and Patrick James. We also welcome Kurt Spreyer back to the squad after a year-long rehab.

The Rusties looked resplendent in their black kits with Trumer Pils splashed across their breasts. As they gathered, they examined the pitch and wondered, “How can it be so muddy since it hasn’t rained in months? And, does anyone ever cut the grass?”

The opening day opponents were Orinda FC, who, truth be told, looked a bit pedestrian in their light blue kits. But, anyway, the season was afoot, and nervous energy filled the air as the Rusties prepared to kick off their latest season. Normally, this reporter would spend the next several paragraphs weaving fantastic yarns about the quality of play of our intrepid squad, but this week, facts trump narrative and we simply present you with this:

Many thanks to Jak for filming and editing.
