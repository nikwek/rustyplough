Such a great match, such brilliant coaching, and yet, no one was inspired to do a write-up... Well, here's an exclusive insight into the brilliant strategery executed by the management team:

At 12:27, Jeremy scored a left-footed goal which is remarkable on many fronts:

Jeremy took a shotJeremy used his left footJeremy actually hit the targetThe ref saw nothing wrong with it

Let's move on to the second half:

There was much more excitement in the 2nd half...

In the 65th minute, Juventus launched a counterattack with our defense way up the field and equalized. 1:1

At 12:25 Jose launched a cross from the left into the box where Dale calmly waited and slotted the ball into the net with the side of his foot like a pro.  2:1

The tension on the field was palatable, sparks were flying. Dale got yellow carded and the Juventus#13looked like he was sent off but it was more like a "go to your room" reprimand. No cards were involved.

Most importantly, the brilliant managers earned their beers.
