At first, we thought no-one was paying attention to our match against Oakland OG but turns out that Big Brother was watching. Here's the match write up from OpenAI's content generator:

"Good evening and welcome to tonight's match, where we have the Rusty Plough taking on the Oakland OG. It's been a one-sided affair so far, with the OG dominating the game from the get-go. The Plough's defense, anchored by center backs Nik Wekwerth and Chris Hudson, have been struggling to contain the Oakland attack. The OG's runs down the right hand side have been particularly effective, with two of their goals coming from well-placed crosses.

The Plough's Franco Moriconi has been kept busy in goal, as he's been forced to make several saves to keep the score from getting worse. The Plough have been unable to create any real chances in the first half, and unfortunately, they're trailing by three goals at the half with a score of 3:0 in favor of the Oakland OG.

In the second half, the Plough tried to mount a comeback, but the Oakland OG defense stood firm and didn't give the Plough any room to operate. The Oakland OG sealed the game with a fourth goal in the second half. The final score, 4-0 in favor of the Oakland OG. It was a tough night for the Rusty Plough, but the Oakland OG deserved the win with their dominant performance."
