Our manager was too lazy to write anything about this game, or he was just overwhelmed trying to remember who scored what and when. Luckily enough, Jak shot a video of the match. Grab some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy!

## UPDATE

Our manager came through and posted a summary. There is some controversy though. We thought we scored 12 but the officials only reported 11…

## First Half: 6-1 Rusties

- Steve opened the scoring by stroking home a sweet right footed volley off a corner from Gerardo.
- Tyler collected a pass from Dale, blew past their central defender, and finished clinically.
- Dale cut in from the baseline and smashed a left-footed shot into the far corner of the goal.
- Tyler played a perfect through ball that Peter collected in space, 1-on-1 with the keeper. Peter squared for Dale to tap home into an empty net.
- Kurt came bombing down the right side and cut the ball back to Tyler, whose first touch popped the ball up in the air, and whose second touch was a volley that flew past the keeper.
- They scored on a PK after a handball on Roberto whistled in our box.
- Right before halftime, Jose ran onto a bouncing ball in the box and cheekily chipped the keeper. **6-1 Plough at halftime.**

## Second Half: also 6-1 Rusties?

- Dale got 1 v. 1 on the keeper and blasted a low, hard shot home.
- Tyler did a great flick-on header and Dale lobbed the stranded keeper from 40 yards out.
- They scored at the near post on PJ.
- Jose stripped the once-again-out-of-position keeper and slotted home into an empty net.
- ???? other goal ???? Does anyone remember this goal (or did we imagine it?)
- Tyler was manhandled in the box and we were awarded a PK. Gerardo (graciously) and Eric (less graciously) allowed Peter to take it. Peter side-footed it past the keeper and into the right hand side of the goal.
- They won a penalty when PJ took down Africari Eric in the box. PJ got a yellow card...and then saved the penalty that was high and right down the middle.
- Final goal: Dale played Peter into space down the left, Peter drew out the keeper and squared for Eric to slot home.
