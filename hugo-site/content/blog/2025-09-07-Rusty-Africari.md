Early September brings with it hope and optimism. Why, because the Rusty Plough is undefeated and dreams of a successful season dance through the heads of the Rustie’s legions of fans. This season brings even more hope as the Rusties announced that this year they would have A PLAN\! Yes, during the summer transfer market, Peter Welch approach Rusty management and requested to become player/manager. He stated his case clearly “I think we should have an approach that we use from week to week and not just show up and hope for the best.” Management conferred for several seconds before accepting the request. 

In addition to a new manager, the Rusties also saw personnel changes. Adam Faughnan decided that too many injuries had piled up and he stepped away. Eric Kuehnl informed the team that his other career as the lead singer in a band had to take precedence, Estefanos Tesfe informed the club that his schedule was too difficult to commit to weekly matches and Akio Sato decided that he would prefer to play with girls. Eric, Stef and Akio may make appearances during times of shorthandedness. The departing players were replaced by the return of Jakapran Kiriruangchai and James Howe (who apparently was part of the early Starry Plough) and newcome Michael Fitzgerald (38\!\!).

As the clock on Sunday morning ticked over to half eight, this reporter looked at around the field. Despite manager Welch’s demand that players be on pitch 30 minutes before game time, only four players were actually there (Welch, himself, was not one of them). But t’was a beautiful morning and the Rusties mostly did arrive in time to warm up and receive words of wisdom. An email had gone out with starting positions and planned playing time. The 4-2-3-1 formation was clearly described. Pressing the wings\! How to attack corner kicks\! Kick-off plays. Could this rag-tag bunch keep all of that information in their pea-sized brains???

It goes without saying that the Rusties looked spectacular in their yellow kits with, once again, primary team sponsor Trumer Pils emblazoned across the chest. However, the sharp look was offset by the sickly stank of jerseys folded and put away while still wet. While not as disgusting as a similar incident that occurred during the club’s summer participation in 8v8 EBSSL club cup, it was bad enough to ensure that Nik will not be asked to wash jerseys ever again.

But enough preamble\! The clock struck 9am and the match began. Within seconds, Africari, the opponents on the day, raced past the center backs and had a look at goal. Fortunately, Kurt was alert and made the save. The Rusties would have to wake up.

And wake up they did, despite pre-season concerns, the Welch plan seemed to work. Certainly, improvements will be made, particularly as it related to offensive midfielders getting back on defensive duties, but there was a plan and the Plough more or less stuck to it. There are too many details for this aging brain to remember, but first half highlights included:

An incredible finger tip save onto the cross bar by Kurt to prevent a goal on a breakaway; A cracker of a shot by Gerardo (who later claimed he “didn’t quite get it”) parried by an equally fine save by the Africari keeper; Jamie using his long legs to tie up Africari attackers; Michael making us all jealous of his youth as he ran rampant up and down the left flank; Tyler working tylerlessly to get open and harass the defenders; Ben, despite not being 38, pretty much matching Michael’s energy and intensity. I’m pretty sure we missed a sitter, I think they hit the post. Regardless, the match was tied 0-0 at the break.

The break was eerily calm. There were no Italian managers running around asking if we should change the formation. Players took on water and, because they had read the email, they knew where to go to start the half. Some, apparently, even knew that there was a kickoff plan (this writer was not one of those in the know).

The Rusty Plough was the far superior side in the second half. Temporarily injured Jeremy G managed the sub process ensuring that players knew where and when to take the field. James, Adam and Gerardo kept Africari out of the middle of the pitch. In fact, the entire Africari attack became a series of long balls down their left side trying to beat the Rusty defense. Meanwhile, the Plough was passing and moving with runs down the center, down the wings, balls back to the supporting mids. It was a sight to behold.

With about 20 minutes to play, Jose, playing on the right, received a pass and challenged his defender, the defender bought the fake and Jose sprinted past him towards the end line. Nik, standing on the sidelines commented “It’s too bad he doesn’t have a right foot.”  Jose must have heard this dis as he lofted a cross into the box. Peter charged it down and slammed it…..oh wait, now, he didn’t slam it. It is unclear what he actually did, but the ball popped up softly towards the goal. The Africari keeper slapped at it, other people were jumping around, and then Jose shouted “Yeaaahhhhhh” and the Rusties had a 1-0 lead. VAR confirmed that the goal was awarded to Welch.

The Rusties continued to attack. It is hard to remember who had chances, but Gaston was finding space and moving the ball into strong positions. Michael may have shown that he needs to work on his shooting touch. Logan, playing his first 11v11 since his knee injury, added speed and threats throughout the half. Roberto, Chris and Jamie (Los Titanicos) held down the area in front of the goal. Nik, despite being this year’s most “experienced” player, displayed some of his trademark anger and physicality and tortured the Africari defenders.

As the pressure kept building, Peter found himself free down the left side and slammed a ball across the box. The keeper dove, but missed and the ball found the feet of Tyler, who was, maybe, six feet in front of the goal. Per the striker’s post-game comments, his only thought was “don’t sky it” so he hit the ball softly towards the open net. Unfortunately, it was too soft and barely went anywhere, allowing an Africari defender to arrive on the scene. Both players wound up on the ground, arms and legs akimbo, as they flailed at the ball. Suddenly, the net rippled\! The ref blew his whistle. The Rusties were up 2….. oh wait. He has called a foul. On Tyler? Weren’t both players on the ground? Weren’t they both kicking the ball? Could it not as easily have been a penalty? Apparently not, the score remained 1-0.

As many of you know, Chris is a Fulham fan. And what does Fulham do more than any other team? That’s right, drop points from winning positions. With a few minutes to go, Africari again dumped a ball down their left side. Their winger cut the ball back to their number 11, guarded by Chris. 11 moved to pass the ball back to the winger who had continued his run. Chris bought the move hook, line and sinker and stepped to defend the winger. Ben shouted “Noooooo” as 11 kept the ball and pivoted towards goal. Jamie tried valiantly to close the space, but it had all happened too fast. 11 calmly slotted the ball to the far post, past Kurt’s outstretched arms. Africari tied the match. Shortly thereafter, the game came to a close.
