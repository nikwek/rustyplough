The gamesmanship started when the Plough arrived at the field. The Africari players, who had arrived well before the Plough, had donned black jerseys. But the Plough, as the visiting team, decided that black was the order of the day as the yellow Trumer Pils logo would stand out on a slightly gray morning. Africari was forced the switch to their back-up jerseys.

Then, for the second week in a row, the Rusties won the toss and the Plough were able to choose which end to defend. Things seemed to be in the Rusties’ favor.

And then, the game started. Manager Wekwerth, despite have masterminded the 4-2-3-1 defensive set that beat top of the table Clayton last week, decided on a 4-3-3. He demanded that his squad “score early and often.” His players shrugged, and took to the pitch.

The 4-3-3 turned out to offer opportunities, but also challenges. The Plough actually enjoyed most of the possession early in the match and looked the stronger of the sides. But there was a hint of confusion amongst the players to this relatively unusual formation. During one of these moments of confusion, Africari launched a half-hearted attack. The ball came into the box and center back Hudson headed it clear. Unfortunately, the Rusties mid-field was a bit stretched / vacant and one of the Africari players controlled the ball. He cleared his feet, and fired a shot from 25 yards out. The ball flew towards the net, keeper Forsyth back-pedaled. He did his best to stretch out his arm, but the ball cleared his finger tips and hit the crossbar. It then bounced down and into the net. The Rusties were down a goal.

Despite giving up an early goal, the Plough remained confident. Although they were not at their best, there was good ball movement and a good amount of possession. In the 17th minute, Peter Welch, Peter F’in Welch, chose to ignore his German Manager. He took the ball down the left side and dribbled his defender. Upon reaching the end line, he turned and dazzled the next defender with his footwork. He looked up, spotted Gerardo Delgadillo in the box and slid him a perfect pass. The mostly right-footed Gerardo swept his left foot through the ball. The Africari keeper got a small touch, but couldn’t prevent the ball from going into the net. 1-1.

Africari immediately re-grouped and came storming back. The forward got a lucky bounce and fired a shot off towards goal. Keeper Forsyth could have simply stepped to his right and collected the ball, but he saw an opportunity to make it look good with a dive and full stretch to catch the ball and keep the score knotted at one.

The Plough, then again, found some joy. Left back Faucette, won a ball and passed it forward to Herrarte. Herrarte played it forward to Welch. Peter F’in Welch. Once again, Welch dribbled his defender and then dribbled towards his goal. As he neared the goal, both Delgadilo and Kuehnl were in the box ready to receive the pass. The Africari keeper shaded towards the two players in the box.  Welch saw his opportunity and, despite the fact that he has two right feet, he calmly slotted the ball behind the keeper with his LEFT FOOT! The Plough was up 1-2.

The Plough had a chance to extend their lead when Emeriti Moriconi drifted into open space near the top of the 18. He received a pass and had lots of time and space, but he tried to shoot quickly and dragged his effort wide.

But then, Africari was ready to respond, and they drove the play into the Rusty half of the field. There may have been a corner kick or there may have just been a cross, but there lots of Africari players in the Rusty box. An Africari player headed the ball towards the goal, but center back Robertio Viveros blocked the attempted shot. Despite being just 1 foot from the Africari player, the ref decided that Viveros’ arms were in an unnatural position and he awarded a PK. Forsyth guessed correctly and dove to his right. He got his fingertips to the ball, but could not keep it out of the back of the net. 2-2.

At this point a Rusty player, who shall remain nameless, questioned the manager’s tactics. The manager swore at his charges, and then directed them to switch to a 4-4-2. Shortly thereafter, Giovannetti fired a shot from 30 yards, but the Africari keeper was able to tip it over the bar. Not much else happened until halftime.

At half-time, manager Wekwerth channeled all of his Manchester United fandom and took out the world famous Sir Alex Ferguson hair dryer. He castigated his players for their stupidity and ineptitude. He told them how EASY and 4-3-3 formation would be if ONLY the players spoke to each other. He DEMANDED that the Plough revert to the 4-3-3 and that they PLAY IT CORRECTLY. The Rusties were appropriately terrified of their obviously insane manager and agreed to do their best.

The second half started and the Plough did indeed improve their communications. The also switched to a high-line defensively to keep the squad more compact. But it was Africari that had the first chance of the half. After some nice play, one of their strikers found himself alone to Forsyth’s right. He slotted the ball into the net, but the referee determined, correctly, that he had been offsides.

Africari had another chance ten minutes later when defender Hudson failed at an attempt to cut off a pass and the Africari striker bore down on goal with a desperate Hudson chasing. The defender’s blushes were spared when the striker blasted his shot above the goal.

But as the match approached the 70th minute, the Plough’s formation began to pay off. Ben Beach held down the Plough’s right flank. Steve Weinstein was masterful in keeping the midfield compact, challenging for balls, and cutting off pressure. Center back Viveros repeatedly beat Africari on attempted long balls and prevented them from getting behind the defensive line. This was combined with nice passing, switches of field, and crisp ball movement that began to tire Africari. On one such move, Peter F’in Welch once again beat his defender, this time on the right side, and began dribbling towards the 6-yard box. Emeriti striker Michael Furlong had ambled into the box and was looking down at his feet to ensure he didn’t trip. Welch saw his opportunity, and smacked the ball off of Furlong’s lowered head and into the back of the net! Ok, to be fair, Furlong watched Peter dribble and juke his way into the box. He adjusted forward and back to make himself available for a possible pass. At just the right moment Peter placed a ball through the box at about chest height. Furlong, with his nose for the spectacular, hit a glancing blow down and towards the far post. The Africari keeper seemed rooted to the spot as the ball, hit with all of the speed of an underhanded change-up, slowly made its way over the line. The Plough had the lead! Furlong had scored! To celebrate, the 65-year-old removed his shirt and paraded around like a pale and faded Ronaldo. He thoroughly enjoyed his well-earned yellow card.

The goal seemed to demoralize Africari who, according to several players with a comprehensive understanding of the Spanish language, began to yell at each other.  Peter again found himself streaking down the right side and put in a near perfect cross that a charging Gerardo could just not quite reach with his head.  Just a minute later, Herrarte played a pass to Emeriti Moriconi, who laid off a perfectly weighted ball to Kuehnl who was open down the left side. Eric fired a cross to the far post where Peter F’in Welch flew in and hit an absolutely perfect full volley across the goal, over the line and into the side netting. The Rusties had a cushion!

Not long thereafter Peter sent yet another ball into the box. Gerardo and Emeriti Knight were both in the box as the ball landed between them. Lewis, with his back towards goal, shielded the defender and slid the ball towards Gerardo. Gerardo took full advantage of Lewis’ block and slid the ball past the keeper to put the Plough up 2-5.

At this point, manager Wekwerth unleashed his secret weapon. Emeriti Patrick Fisher took the pitch for the first time this season. He ran to and fro. He ran here and there. He then ran hither and yon. His travels eventually led him to the top of the 18-yard box where Herrarte played a perfect ball to him. Would Paddy do a quick flick with his right foot? A backheel? A dummy to Faucette who was open behind him? Nope. He tried to trap it, but didn’t keep it quite close enough and Africari cleared the danger.

Soon thereafter, the ref blew the full-time whistle and the Plough walked off the pitch with a 5-2 victory.

Peter Welch, Peter F’in Welch, either scored or assisted on every single one of the Plough’s five goals. The day’s man-of-the-match was a no brainer.
