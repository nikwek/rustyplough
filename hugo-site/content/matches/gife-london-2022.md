In April 2022, the Rusty Plough played a re-match against the Sticky Buns in a much less stabby part of London than the first match. Leasing a double decker team bus was a stroke of genius. The pitch was wonderful and the atmosphere was electric. Sticky Buns turned out to be a little rustier than the Rusty Plough, but they were still a fun opponent. Much fun was had during the game and more importantly in the club house post-match.
