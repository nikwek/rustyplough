The fifth edition of the Greatest International Friendly Ever took place in Berlin, Germany. Stefan helped organize the team in Berlin. We met some of the X Kickers at a Hertha BSC game before the GIFE - that's where it became apparent that X Kickers were quite a bit younger than we were... I would say their average age was about 35 compared to our average age of 55. As expected, X Kickers were a formidable opponent.  Despite the scoreline, X Kickers brought the best out of the Rusty Plough squad - I felt we played better than ever. Most importantly, we had a TON of fun. After the game we went to X Kickers' favorite Croatian restaurant where we enjoyed beers, Cevapcici, Raznički, other delicacies, and of course Slivovits!
