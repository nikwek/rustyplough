Letâ€™s face it, the French feel like there is something missing. And we know what it is! They have yet to be graced by 
the presence of the world-famous Rusty Plough! And so, to rectify their ennui, we are prepared to raise their spirits 
(and perhaps a few spirits for ourselves) by embarking on:

# Le GIFÃ‰

This will be the sixth edition of the Greatest International Friendly Ever. Julien Veyrac, formerly of Furlongâ€™s 
basement, has extended an invitation to take on the French in the Boulogne neighborhood of Paris. 

We have been promised the following:

- 11v11
- Full field
- Players over 40 (maybe even over 45!)

The preliminary schedule is as follows:
- April 9 (Thursday) Players to be in Paris on or by this day. Welcome dinner / drinks with our hosts in the evening.
- April 10 (Friday) Sightseeing / no official activities (although there is always something going on with this group).
- April 11 (Saturday) Le GIFE match day. Kickoff at 10:45am. Post game libations and, of course, dÃ©jeuner (thatâ€™s lunch).
- April 12 (Sunday) Paris FC v Monaco at Stade Jean Bouin

We will likely add more activities before and/or after the official travel dates, but this short
itinerary would be the minimum travel time.
