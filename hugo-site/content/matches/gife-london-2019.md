The original inspiration for this GIFE was Jeff and Jose's 50th birthdays and their strong desire to watch Premier League matches in London and play another GIFE. With help from Jeff's friend, Eric Strauch, on the ground in London, we found a team and put together a memorable week. 

In the words of Jeff: "The birthday and the blazer have exceeded all expectations. We have had an amazing week in London. Watched some games and played a great international friendly last night against Sticky Buns FC, some friends of Strauch‚Äôs. Ended in a 2-2 draw after one of them backheeled in a loose ball following a corner kick in the 86th minute. As one of them said, ‚Äúfootball wins‚Äù.

Here's an excerpt of a video that Jeff created:
