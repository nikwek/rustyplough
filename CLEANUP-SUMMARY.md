## 🎯 What to Use

**For everything:** Use the `hugo-site/` directory

**Commands:**
```bash
# Start dev server
cd hugo-site && hugo server

# Add blog post
cd hugo-site && hugo new content/blog/post-name.md

# Build for production
cd hugo-site && hugo
```

## 🗑️ Can I Delete old-static-site/?

**Yes**, once you're confident the Hugo site works well.

The `old-static-site/` folder is just a backup. Everything has been migrated to Hugo.

**To delete:**
```bash
rm -rf old-static-site/
```
